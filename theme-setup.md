General notes and suggestions for customizing **So Simple Theme**.

#Title 
 is content
[^1]: Used to generate absolute urls in *sitemap.xml*, *feed.xml*, and for canonical urls in *head.html*. Don't include a trailing `/` in your base url ie: http://mademistakes.com. When developing locally remove or comment out this line so local CSS, JS, and image assets are used.
